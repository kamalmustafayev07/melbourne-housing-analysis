# Melbourne Housing Market Analysis

This project presents a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Melbourne housing dataset**, built using **Python 3.11**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to understand the key drivers behind housing prices in Melbourne by cleaning the data, analyzing relationships, and visualizing meaningful trends.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project is organized into three notebooks, each representing a key step in the data analytics workflow:

| Notebook | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **01_data_preparation.ipynb** | Loads the dataset, inspects data structure, handles missing values, and performs initial cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis. |
| **02_data_analysis.ipynb** | Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA): computes key statistics, explores correlations, identifies top influential features, and generates insights without visualization. |
| **03_data_visualization.ipynb** | Creates data visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate distributions, feature relationships, and summary findings through plots and charts. |
