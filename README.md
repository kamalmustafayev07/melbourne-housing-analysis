# Melbourne Housing Market Analysis  
*Data-Driven Insights on Property Prices in Melbourne, Australia*

## Overview  
This project presents a **comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the **Melbourne housing market**, focusing on understanding which property and location features most influence sale prices.  
The analysis is built using **Python** and **Poetry** for environment management, combining statistical techniques and data visualisation to uncover key market patterns and drivers.

The findings provide valuable insights for **buyers, investors, policymakers, and real estate professionals** to make more informed, data-driven decisions.

## Data Preparation & Cleaning  

The raw dataset required significant preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.  

### Steps:
1. **Data Loading:**  
   Imported using `pandas` and initial inspection performed.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**  
   - Replaced empty strings with `NaN`.  
   - Created a helper function `check_missing_columns()` to identify incomplete data.  

3. **Imputation:**  
   - Filled missing categorical data (`Suburb`, `Regionname`, `CouncilArea`) using grouped mode values.  
   - Imputed `Price` by suburb/region mean.  
   - Replaced missing or zero values in `Distance`, `Landsize`, and `BuildingArea` with grouped medians.  
   - Filled missing `YearBuilt`, `Bathroom`, `Car` with statistical aggregates.  
   - Replaced invalid zeros and aligned `Bedroom2` with `Rooms`.

4. **Final Adjustments:**  
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (Latitude, Longitude).  
   - Renamed inconsistent columns (`Rooms` ‚Üí `Bedroom`).  
   - Validated types and ranges for `Date`, `YearBuilt`, and `Price`.  
   - Saved cleaned dataset as `Melbourne_cleaned.csv`.

## Research Questions  
- What property and location features most influence housing prices in Melbourne?  
- How do market dynamics vary between suburbs and regions?  
- Which properties or areas perform best for investment and buyer interest?

## Analysis & Insights  

### **Insight 1 ‚Äî Properties with Larger Land Size**  
Filtered properties with land size above average to explore premium market segments.  
This analysis revealed that **location, year built, and distance from the CBD** strongly correlate with higher land-value properties.

---

### **Insight 2 ‚Äî Top Property Recommendations**  
Identified and ranked **top 10 properties overall** based on value, region, and physical features.  
A random property from the top selection was highlighted to simulate a data-driven buyer recommendation.

---

### **Insight 3 ‚Äî Top 10 Houses per Suburb**  
Grouped data by **suburb** to extract top properties in each neighborhood.  
This localized analysis revealed distinct value clusters and price differences across Melbourne‚Äôs districts.

---

### **Insight 4 ‚Äî Top 10 Houses per Region**  
Aggregated the data by **regional zones**, identifying broader market patterns.  
Regions closer to the CBD or coastal areas consistently showed higher mean prices, revealing strong geographic influence.

---

## Key Findings  

- **Property prices** are primarily driven by:
  - Land size  
  - Distance from the CBD  
  - Number of bedrooms  
  - Year built  
  - Seller performance  

- **Regional differences** show that inner-city and eastern suburbs command significantly higher median prices.  

- **Market distribution** varies by property type, with **houses** dominating higher-value segments compared to **units or townhouses**.

- **Sellers and agents** also impact price outcomes ‚Äî some agencies consistently achieve higher selling prices per region.

---

## Limitations  

- Dataset is limited to **Melbourne**; findings may not generalize to other markets.  
- Some off-market or private sales are **not included**.  
- Statistical imputations may not fully represent true missing values.  
- External factors (e.g., economy, policy, or construction trends) are **not modeled**.  
- Real estate markets evolve rapidly ‚Äî the dataset represents a **historical snapshot**.

## Conclusion  

The analysis concludes that **location, land size, and property condition** are the primary determinants of housing prices in Melbourne.  
Both **micro-level (suburb)** and **macro-level (regional)** analyses reveal market diversity, providing **practical insights** for buyers, investors, and developers seeking data-backed decision support.
